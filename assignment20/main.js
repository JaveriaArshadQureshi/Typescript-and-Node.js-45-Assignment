// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
// rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a 
// list containing these items.
var inputDevices = ["Mouse", "Keyboard", "Printer", "Scanner"];
console.log("List of Input Devices");
inputDevices.forEach(function (device) { console.log(device); });
