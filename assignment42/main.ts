// Assignment 42

// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() 
// that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. 
// Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(name => 
        console.log(name)); 
    }

function make_great(magicians: string[]){
    return magicians.map (name => `The Great ${name}`);
}

let magician_name: string[] = ["David Copperfield", "Doug Henning", "Lance Burton"];

let great_magicians = make_great(magician_name);

show_magicians(great_magicians);
